# CISC-179
Python Project


LIMITS OF THE BODY: 
The program was created as a modern and ethical adaptation of a side show attraction. An attraction where a user could enter their data and test it compared to other people that have broken world records. The program is user friendly and pretty simple. Data like age, height and name are collected at the beginning of the program and are used through out the whole experience. Visualizers are used in all the different segments in order to be encourage more engagement from the user. These visualizers are completely dependant on the users information. The program also has presaved profiles for the people that have broken world records. These profiles interact with the implemented code in a way that allows for updated entries. The method definitions at the start of the program could support new profiles if needed. The program is work in progress and maybe could expand with more segments in the future.
